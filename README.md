## What I Learned
- Use MongoDB's transaction to edit multiple related documents to ensure data consistency across all collections.
- Chain multiple middlewares(e.g call login middleware after successful sign up to automatically authenticate the user).
- Write custom express validator with custom methods.
- Write custom error formatter to ensure consistent error format response across all middlewares.
- Deep populate MongoDB documents.

## Things to imrpove
- Refactor the codebase using Typescript
